## About this ETCLabs Project
The OSCLayouts in this project (developed by a combination of end users and ETC employees in their free time) are designed to interact with Electronic Theatre Controls products. This is not official ETC software. For challenges using, integrating, compiling, or modifying items in this project, we encourage posting on the [Issues](https://github.com/ElectronicTheatreControlsLabs/OSCLayouts/issues) page. ETC Support is not familiar with this software and will not be able to assist if issues arise. (Hopefully issues won't happen, and you'll have a lot of fun with these tools and toys!)

We also welcome pull requests for bug fixes and feature additions.

The *User-Submitted* folder contains layouts created & shared by users, and ETC is not responsible for them in any way.
